# Projects
This is a list of my school projects.

## Game_Development

In this folder, I have 2 different games:
* 2D Top-down Shooter, my bachelor's degree

**Outlaw Outpost** is a top-down 2D shooter set in the exciting world of the Wild West.
Follow in the footsteps of an adventure-seeking cowboy who is determined to save his
town from Jack McCallister, a cynical outlaw gang boss presented with eye-catching
visual graphics and several innovative gameplay mechanics. The paper aims to detail
several techniques and applications used to develop a complete video game in Unity.
The development process of the game was divided into several stages: we established
the gameâ€™s goals and developed the basic concepts and concept map, I designed the game
defining the game mechanics, story, and levels, I created visual elements using Photoshop,
I moved to the programming stage and implemented the game mechanics in the chosen
engine, I added visual and auditory elements, and finally, I put the game through a testing
process to eliminate errors.
To complete this project, I used several insights gained during my three years of
university: planning and developing an application, using a C# language game engine,
and using object-oriented programming. In addition, I learned how to develop a complete
and complex game using newly acquired information, which is a deeper understanding of
the code, the objects used in the game, and the multitude of features that Unity provides.
In the end, I combined the steps of developing a game with original characters, stories,
ideas, visuals, and mechanics along with the information and skills I have acquired through
years of study and my own experiences to develop a project that is based on creating
an enjoyable and relaxing experience for players that sparks interest, empathy, and a desire
for adventure.
  

## Object-oriented_programming

Multiple C++ projects from the first course that we learned OOP. Each problem has a document where the requirements are.

* What I used:
   * C++
   * CodeBlocks
   * STL
   * Basic OOP: Constructors, Classes, Getter, Setter, Destructor, Original operators, Upcasting, Downcasting, Virtual functions, Static variables, Interactive Menu, Templates, Abstract classes, RTTI, Exceptions, Diamond problem

## Advanced_object-oriented_programing 

A more complex OOP project, using more complicated relationships between classes, and more complex OOP concepts in general. This project simulates a library that contains multiple types of different books that a student can lend.

* What I used:
   * Java
   * IntelliJ
   * advanced OOP

##Oracle_SQL - Hotel management database

Project made to learn all the aspects of SQL, from designing a database to adding many complex queries and relationships.
